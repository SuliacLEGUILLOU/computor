Polyno;ial equation solver
Coded in Perl, with lib :
	FindBin

	Local module
This project have to implement math module :
	Solver:		Provide solving tool
	Math:		Provide basic math tool (ft_sqrt)

	Projet commentary
The main part of the project is functionnal and (almost) clean.
For computorV2, think about refactoring the computorV1.pl file to get polynom
manipulation tool in a separated module, and possibly rename the solver (and
maybe a little refactoring for solve-poly2 ?).
